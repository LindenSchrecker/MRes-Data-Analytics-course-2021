# Data Analytics for MRes Advanced Molecular Synthesis

Recent advances in synthetic methodologies include many interdisciplinary elements (e.g., photochemistry, flow chemistry), which require modern synthetic chemistry to move towards a more data-driven discipline. 

This series of workshops on Data Analytics will introduce basic concepts from the fields of data science and machine learning. 
Starting with simple tools from computational statistics, such as linear and logistic regression,  we will progress all the way through to the current hot topic of machine learning, Artificial Neural Networks, touching on several established methods on the way, e.g. Random Forests, SVMs, PCA and much more.

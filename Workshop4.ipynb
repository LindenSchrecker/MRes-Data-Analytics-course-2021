    "\n",
    "- Many modern technologies are inspired by nature: Birds taught us to fly, burrs of burdock motivated the invention of velcro, bats' and dolphins' ability to use echolocation led to sonars and so on. It therefore seems logical to turn to the **brain's architecture to seek inspiration for intelligent machines**. \n",
    "- An *Artificial Neural Network (ANN)* is a Machine Learning model inspired by the networks of biological neurons found in our brains. \n",
    "\n",
    "- A short history:\n",
    "    * First introduced in 1943 by neurophysiologist Warren McCulloch and mathematician Walter Pitts in the landmark paper [\"A logical calculus of the ideas immanent in nervous activity\"](https://doi.org/10.1007/BF02478259).\n",
    "    * With the widespread belief that we would soon be conversing with intelligent machines, an initial hype period ensued, until the 1960s when the hype died down and funding went dry.\n",
    "    * After a long hibernation, the 1980s saw a slow revival as new architectures and better training techniques became available, particular with the publication of the [\"Hopfield net\"](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.79.8.2554) in 1982 and the establishment of the \"Neural Networks for Computing\" conference by the American Institute of Physics in 1985. \n",
    "    * Until the 1990s, preference was mostly given to other ML techniques, such as Support Vector Machines as they provided better results.\n",
    "    * We are now in the midst of another wave of excitement, but will it last? Most people might argue that it will, with the advent of massive amounts of data, the increase in computing power and the continued theoretical development towards better algorithms. \n",
    "- ANNs are powerful and scalable and therefore able to: \n",
    "    * classify billions of images\n",
